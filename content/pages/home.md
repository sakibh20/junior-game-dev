## Testimonials

**Hicham R.**, *Upwork Client*.
> “I have worked with Hasan Sakib on a big project on September 2020. It's an AR catalog of our products developed with Unity3D. At the beginning I was skeptical because a lot of guys were telling me different things, but Hasan was giving me the right information that helped me better understand the AR world and how to do things correctly. The project took 35 days and my team and I were so glad of the result. It was an excellent experience I'm proud of. We will entrust all our next AR projects to him for sure.”

**Yeovil**, *Upwork Client*
> “Sakib worked hard to meet our tight initial deadline. His communication was excellent and always strived to meet our requirements. The project in question was somewhat experimentational and therefore plans and decisions changed regularly. Sakib was always up for the challenge. Looking forward to engaging him again.”
