* **Multiplayer Bluff Mechanics**: Players take turns rolling dice and bluffing opponent players strategically.
* **Robust Authentication Flow**: Includes user registration, login, and game state synchronization through a secure API.
* **Support Utilities in Python**: Includes tooling for encryption, JSON transformation, and API testing via Postman.

This project highlights the importance of secure game development and demonstrates a complete flow from player input to server validation.
