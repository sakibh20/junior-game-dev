# Unity Custom Editor Window for ScriptableObject Serialization & Addressables Integration

This repository presents a **custom-built Editor Window** designed to automate and simplify the management of complex **ScriptableObject** data structures in Unity. This tool supports full **JSON serialization and deserialization**, and integrates seamlessly with Unity's **Addressables system** — all from a user-friendly, tabbed editor interface.

## Key Features

- **Multi-tabbed Custom Editor Window** for a clean and modular interface.
- **Export ScriptableObjects to JSON**, with full support for:
  - Nested classes
  - Enums
  - Polymorphic data structures and inheritance
- **Regenerate ScriptableObjects from JSON**, preserving:
  - Data integrity
  - Field types
  - Nested structures
- **Accurate type mapping** based on base and derived classes.

---

## Addressables Integration

This tool goes a step further by automating asset setup for Unity’s **Addressable Asset System**:

- All generated assets are added to the **correct Addressable Groups**.
- Assets are tagged with **appropriate Addressable labels** based on their type/configuration.
- Ready for remote content updates, builds, and clean runtime use — no manual setup required.

---

## Why It Matters

Managing complex data-driven systems in Unity often leads to repetitive tasks, error-prone manual setups, and bloated inspectors. This Editor Window:

- Automates asset generation from config files
- Supports **version control-friendly JSON** structures
- Enforces clean data pipelines for modular systems

Ideal for games with **procedural content, large item databases, or layered gameplay mechanics** powered by ScriptableObjects.

---

## Built With

- Unity Editor API (CustomWindow, EditorGUILayout, Tabs)
- Newtonsoft JSON (or Unity's JsonUtility)
- ScriptableObject architecture with inheritance and polymorphism
- Addressables API (`AddressableAssetSettings`, `AssetLabelReference`, etc.)

---

## Project Status

This tool was developed and deployed as part of a real-world game development pipeline, dramatically improving productivity for large content teams.
